      <h2>Hello </h2>
      <p>My name is Shafiqa Nabila Kamil. I love writing diaries, practicing English, and sharing my thoughts here. I made this website with the hope i could practice my english to get better while learning coding. I'm also a big fan of strawberries. I own so many strawberry-themed things just because i love how pretty the color combination or red and green in one thing. I'm also open to everyone who's into Hindia, .Feast, NCT, rumahsakit, and STAYC! Contact me through shafiqanabila03@gmail.com </p>
